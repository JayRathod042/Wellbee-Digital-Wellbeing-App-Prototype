Objective: To recreate a digital well-being app that better addresses user needs and enhances their overall experience, promoting healthier digital habits.

Project Phases:

Phase 1: User Research

In the initial phase, our team conducted comprehensive user research to gather insights on current digital well-being experiences and identify areas for improvement. We engaged with over 30 individuals through interviews and distributed a survey via Google Forms with more than 300 responses. The survey focused on understanding users' experiences with existing digital well-being apps and soliciting their suggestions for enhancements. This extensive research provided valuable data that informed our design process.

Phase 2: Paper Prototyping

Based on the insights from our user research, we proceeded to the ideation and prototyping stage. We incorporated user suggestions into our design and developed paper prototypes of the new app. This phase was crucial for visualizing our ideas and iterating on the design based on feedback from our initial concepts.
Phase 3: Digital Prototyping with Figma
In the final phase, we transitioned our paper prototypes into a digital format using Figma. We designed detailed wireframes and an interactive software prototype, ensuring that the app's functionality and user interface met the needs identified during our research. This prototype allowed us to refine our design further and prepare for potential development.


Project Outcome

The culmination of our efforts is "Wellbee," a redesigned digital wellbeing app that addresses user concerns and incorporates their suggestions for a more user-friendly and effective experience. Wellbeing aims to help users monitor and manage their digital habits more effectively, promoting a healthier relationship with technology.

Why Wellbee Stands Out

Wellbee distinguishes itself from existing digital well-being apps through several innovative features designed to address common user frustrations and enhance engagement. 
One of the most significant improvements is the implementation of a strict app timer, addressing the biggest issue users face with current solutions. 
We have replaced the traditional bar graph with a more intuitive design for app usage time analysis, making it easier for users to understand their digital habits. Wellbee also introduces a screen time goal feature, motivating users to manage their usage proactively. 
A unique coin system rewards users for meeting their goals, adding a gamified element to the experience. 
Additionally, motivational messages, warnings, and pop-ups are integrated to keep users on track. 
Finally, we have categorized screen time, allowing users to see a detailed breakdown of their usage, which helps them make more informed decisions about their digital habits.

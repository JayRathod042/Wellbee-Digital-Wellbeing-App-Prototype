User Research 

In this phase, our team conducted comprehensive user research to gather insights on current digital well-being experiences and identify areas for improvement. 
We engaged with over 30 individuals through interviews and distributed a survey via Google Forms with more than 300 responses. 
The survey focused on understanding users' experiences with existing digital well-being apps and soliciting their suggestions for enhancements. 
This extensive research provided valuable data that informed our design process.

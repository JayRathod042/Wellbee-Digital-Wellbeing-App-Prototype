In the final phase, we transitioned our paper prototypes into a digital format using Figma. 
We designed detailed wireframes and an interactive software prototype, ensuring that the app's functionality and user interface met the needs identified during our research. 
This prototype allowed us to refine our design further and prepare for potential development.
